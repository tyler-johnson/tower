//! `ff-tower` — the board, and the verbs around it.
//!
//! One binary under one name, and the name is fufu's dispatch name: `ff
//! tower <verb>` finds `ff-tower` on PATH the way git finds a subcommand.
//! There is no bare `tower` binary. The verb is reached through fufu
//! because the dependency is real — tower has nothing to say about a
//! machine with no fufu on it — and one spelling means no question about
//! which one is canonical.
